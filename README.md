# United Nations General Debate

Every year since 1947, representatives of UN member states gather at the annual sessions of the United Nations General Assembly. The centrepiece of each session is the [General Debate](https://gadebate.un.org/en). This is a forum at which leaders and other senior officials deliver statements that present their government's perspective on the major issues in world politics.

These statements are akin to the annual legislative state-of-the-union addresses in domestic politics. No other international forum provides all member states with the opportunity to deliver their state-of-the-world addresses in a comparable format.

The General Debate provides a unique and invaluable source of information on the preferences of states on the widest range of policy issues. Issues of strategic importance for the world.

This new dataset, the UN General Debate Corpus (UNGDC), introduces the corpus of texts of General Debate statements from 1970 (Session 25) to 2017 (Session 72). For a full description of the UNGDC, please see the [accompanying paper](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2053168017712821).
